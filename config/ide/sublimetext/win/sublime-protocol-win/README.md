# sublime-protocol-win

Setting up Custom URI scheme handler for Windows to open files in Sublime editor  
Created to parse URI's generated by [**filp/whoops**](https://github.com/filp/whoops)  
Parsing is done with VBScript, as that was the only way I found to open Sublime editor, while avoiding annoying command prompt window to pop up and close.  

## NOTE
After downloading / cloning the repository, you have to edit files to update path to `open_file.vbs` and to add path to Sublime editor  
Currently I don't have time to create install/uninstall scripts, so any help is welcome  
Also, README.md is all upside-down, so that will be updated soon

## Whoops
whoops is an error handler framework for PHP. [**More about whoops**](https://github.com/filp/whoops)

> When using the pretty error page feature, whoops comes with the ability to open referenced files directly in your IDE or editor.  

More on how to setup sublime [here](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Open%20Files%20In%20An%20Editor.md)

# Setup
In command prompt, navigate to location where you want to clone repository, and run this command  
    `git clone https://github.com/ljubadr/sublime-protocol-win.git`  
Take a note of a folder path where you cloned this repository, as it will be used later  
Navigate to the folder where you cloned repository (downloaded)  

### sublime-custom-protocol.reg
Before you merge this registry file, you need to edit this file.  
Open file `sublime-custom-protocol.reg` in your favourite editor  
On the last line  
`@="WSCRIPT \"C:\\sublime-protocol-win\\open_file.vbs\" \"%1\""`  
**change**  
`C:\\sublime-protocol-win\\`  
to the path where you cloned this repository  
Take a note that you need `\\` in the folder path  
Save the file  
Double click `sublime-custom-protocol.reg` to add new registry entry.  

#### To remove `subl://` protocol
Press Start button, then type `regedit`  
Wait a little bit and in the search result will get `regedit.exe` (Registry Editor)  
Open `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`, and then find `subl`, right click -> delete  

### open_file.vbs
This is the script that will be called to process new custom URI protocol `subl://`  
Open file `open_file.vbs` in editor, and find line  
`sublime_path = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Sublime Text 3\sublime_text.exe"`  
Replace existing path with the path of your Sublime instalation  
Or if you're using Sublime portable, enter path to .exe file  

## You're all set
All pages that have whoops errors will generate url with the link to a file  
When you click on the link for the first time, browser will ask about permissions, so be sure to select allow  

Little note for **Chrome** users, opening files will only work by clickning on generated link  
Trying to paste generated link in URL will not work
